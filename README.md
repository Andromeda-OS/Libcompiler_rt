# Libcompiler_rt

This repository contains a copy of LLVM `libcompiler_rt`,
version 5.0.0, heavily modified to build as part of PureDarwin.
All unneeded files have been removed, including the CMake infrastructure.
Therefore, this repository is generally unusable outside of
the context of the PureDarwin project.
